1.Description

In a first Jupyter notebook called Top10.ipynb, we analyzed what the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in the region with ZIP code 10027, and calculated how many total incidents of each of these 10 types there have been in the year 2020. The output is a pandas.Series called top10 (as a Python variable), which is in descending order by number of incidents, and which contains as its labels the incident type (a string) and as associated values the total number of incidents of this type in 2020.

In a second Jupyter notebook called Parking.ipynb, we analyzed whether illegal parking incidents are a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in the region with ZIP code 10027 than they are in general. Specifically, we computed the total number of parking incidents in 10027, and the total number of all incidents -- is this fraction greater than or smaller than the total fraction of parking incidents across all ZIP codes? Our answer is in the form of a single bool called `higher_parking_proportion` which is True if 10027 contains a higher proportion of parking incidents than the global value, and False otherwise.
